# Florida OSMS COVID19 Maker Files

Design files for the makers community in Florida

This repository serves as a central location for sharing files that are being used by the Florida makers community.

Coca-Cola has generously donated nearly 10 tons of plastic PET sheeting to the state of Florida which is now being distributed through the state. This material can be used to make face shields. It is a bit thicker (34 mil) than the typical face shield material (around 10 mil). For 3D printed brims, the popular Prusa or in general the 'hole punch' design may not work as the plastic is much more resistant to bending. We are still in the testing phases, though.

3D printers can also help the sewing community be more efficient.

Please dive into one of the above categories for plans by production method.

Below are some pictures of the delivery in Orlando:
